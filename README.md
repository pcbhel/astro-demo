# demo-restaurant-astro-json

 An example which uses structure content in JSON files to generate an archetypal restaurant site using [Astro](https://astro.build).

This example is useful for exploring how Astro can generate a site from structured data. You can also use a [decoupled CMS](https://jamstack.org/glossary/decoupling/) to power such a site, either by consuming the CMS data directly from its API, or by adding a small layer of abstraction which populates the site's data files from the CMS ahead of each build.

For an illustration of using Astro with a Netlify Build Plugin to pull content from a decoupled CMS, you can [explore this example](https://github.com/netlify/demo-restaurant-astro-contentful), and [read about this pattern in this blog post](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/10/25/learning-to-future-proof-sites-using-headless-cms-and-different-ssgs/).
